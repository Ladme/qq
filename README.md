**qq** is a lightweight wrapper for batch scheduling systems, designed to provide a consistent and simplified interface across different schedulers. qq makes it easier to submit, monitor, and manage jobs without needing to learn the details of each backend.

**Designed for the specific needs of the [RoVa Research Group](https://vacha.ceitec.cz/).**
