    Details
        Killing a job sets its state to "killed". This is handled either by `qq kill` or
        `qq run`, depending on job type and whether the `--force` flag was used:

        - Forced kills: `qq kill` updates the qq info file to mark the
            job as killed, because `qq run` may not have time to do so.
            The info file is subsequently locked to avoid overwriting.

        - Jobs that have not yet started: `qq run` does not exist yet, so
            `qq kill` is responsible for marking the job as killed.

        - Jobs that are booting: `qq run` does exist for booting jobs, but
            it is unreliable at this stage. PBS's `qdel` may also silently fail for
            booting jobs. `qq kill` is thus responsible for setting the job state
            and locking the info file (which then forces `qq run` to terminate
            even if the batch system fails to kill it).

        - Normal (non-forced) termination: `qq run` is responsible for
            updating the job state in the info file once the job is terminated.
