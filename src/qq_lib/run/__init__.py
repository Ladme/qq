This module defines the `QQRunner` class and related helpers that manage the
execution of qq jobs within a batch system. It is invoked internally through
the `qq run` command, which is hidden from the user-facing CLI.

Lifecycle of a qq job:
    1. Working directory preparation
       - Shared storage jobs: The working directory is set to the job
         submission directory itself.
       - Scratch-using jobs: A dedicated scratch directory (created by the
         batch system) is used as a working directory. Job files are copied
         to a specific directory inside the working directory.

    2. Execution
       The qq info file is updated to record the "running" state.
       The job script is executed.

    3. Finalization
       - On success:
         - The qq info file is updated to "finished".
         - If running on scratch, job files are copied back to the submission
           (job) directory and then removed from scratch.
       - On failure:
         - The qq info file is updated to "failed".
         - If on scratch, files are left in place for debugging.

    X. Cleanup (on interruption)
       If the process receives a SIGTERM, the runner updates the qq info file
       to "killed", attempts to gracefully terminate the subprocess, and forces
       termination with SIGKILL if necessary.

Summary:
    - Shared-storage jobs execute directly in the job directory, with no
      file copying.
    - Scratch-using jobs copy job files to scratch, execute there, and then
      either copy results back (on success) or leave scratch data intact (on
      failure).
