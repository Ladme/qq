**qq** is a lightweight wrapper for batch scheduling systems, designed to provide a consistent and simplified interface across different schedulers. qq makes it easier to submit, monitor, and manage jobs without needing to learn the details of each backend.

Read the [qq manual](https://ladme.github.io/qq-manual) for more information.

**Designed for the specific needs of the [RoVa Research Group](https://vacha.ceitec.cz/).**

### **IMPORTANT: qq is currently in an early stage of development, very unstable and only supports PBS Pro!**
